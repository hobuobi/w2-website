								<p class="style2">The first emergency meeting held on the same day the Sexual Climate Survey results were released summoned a crowd of students filling the Science Center with only standing room. Many people actually were forced to sit in an overflow room next door to watch a live stream of the presentation instead of in person. After sexual assault has plagued college campuses for so long, it was good to see so many people vested in fixing an issue that reportedly affects 1 in 3 senior women on campus.
								<p class = "style2">However, attending every single sexual assault meeting after the first, the number of students in attendance thinned out. Barely a tenth of the people so enthused for the first meeting attended the second. Indeed, every subsequent meeting attracted fewer and fewer students.
								<p class = "style2">It would be tempting to say that students might not care as deeply as the first meeting suggested, that the shock of the survey was only provocative enough to attract large attendance for one time only. We believe that is patently false. Students do care about this issue, but we unfortunately have to face a decision between extracurriculars, a social life, or sleep:  choose two. Students have neither the expertise nor the time to invest themselves in a structural problem that is difficult to solve.
								<p class = "style2">But what if students did not sacrifice one over the other? What if students did not have to choose between their extracurriculars and their desire to change campus? Enter the Gender Equity Bonus. We propose that if a club receives a grant from the UC and they can connect their event to issues of gender equity and sexual assault on campus, we will give them additional money to make it happen. Simple solutions to safer spaces, more inclusive signage at parties, more articles written about intersectionality in journals, and more theatre productions that bring the issue to the stage, are all suddenly possible. Not only possible, but likely. This would be the first ever incentive system ever designed by the Undergraduate Council. Given the UC funds most campus events, 765 events last year to be exact, it seems strange that it is the only organization that hands out $300,000 without providing students incentives to take proactive steps to change our school. “Our current conversations value catharsis over strategy.” Given the chance to lead the UC, we will make it so students do not have to choose between their passion for student life and their passion to make a change. We have twice the Willpower to give students the financial encouragement we need on this campus to address the issues we all care about.
