								<p><strong>BOLSTER MENTAL HEALTH RESORUCES. </strong>
								Right now, students don’t believe in the system. Even if students decide to reach out, UHS often isn’t as ready and available as it should be for mental health. We need a change. That means actually having a diverse UHS staff, having a transparent UHS policy, and guaranteeing students confidentiality when they speak up.</p>
								<p><strong>REDUCE THE STIGMA. </strong>
								Even if students believe Harvard’s mental health resources can help, the fear of being labeled stops people from reaching out for the helping hand they need. We will work with student orgs on campus to promote awareness of the issue and change social norms about what we believe about mental health, and we want the UC grants process to reward clubs who take the initiative with active listening workshops.
								</p>
								<p><strong>CREATE COMMUNITIES OF SUPPORT. </strong>
								Sometimes, a professional counselor just isn’t for everyone. And too often, students feel like they are alone in their struggle. We will reward student organizations that undergo active listening training you’ll find in peer counseling groups. But we wouldn’t stop there. We will create a series of inclusive events called Harvard Listens, where student can feel comfortable opening up about the struggles we all feel as students on campus.

								</p>
								
								<h1>All of these are immediate concerns. We can't wait to get started.</h1>
