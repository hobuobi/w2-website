							<p>This year, social life at Harvard has improved since years past:  There are more parties happening, the final clubs are taking heat, and the Administration has taken active steps to financially support parties on campus. However, we worry that if we do not seize on this momentum on campus, we will miss an opportunity to institutionalize the strides we’ve made. The UC has only so many resources to help the College Events Board and the First Year Social Committee throw parties. Even they have huge financial commitments to great events like Yardfest and Camp Harvard. We acknowledge that the administration has earmarked money for a large party on campus. But both of these stakeholders show the problem:  social events are sporadic at best, and while one large party may be great, the nostalgia of how good that party was won’t make you any less stressed once midterms roll around. We need a system that can enable students to have a good time on a consistent basis.
							<p>There aren’t enough social spaces. For inclusive parties, we have few options:  yes, there is Northwest Labs, the Ten-Man, the Bell-tower, the Aquarium, and the like, but on a campus of over 6000 people where the majority of them want and need some form of social release, these social spaces simply aren’t enough. But with a little creativity, we can find more.
							<p>First, let’s start in our own houses with our dining halls. Every single house’s dining hall is the optimal size for parties of any sort, yet getting access to dining halls is extremely difficult. Adams House alone charges $2000 to gain access for any event.
