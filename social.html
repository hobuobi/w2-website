							<h1> >> SHORT TERM << </h1>
							<p><strong>Streamline Access to Campus Social Spaces. </strong>Spaces aren’t social if students can’t use them. Let’s allow students to use each House’s dining hall for larger, inclusive events and make the process easy. And let’s take away the financial barrier. The Science Center and Annenberg Dining Hall cost thousands of dollars to rent. You shouldn’t have to pay so much to have a good time, so Harvard should either pay the fee or waive the fee.</p>
							<h1>>> MID TERM << </h1>
							<p><strong>Boost Community Support for Sport Events. </strong>The Harvard-Yale Game always goes down as one of the best experiences at school, and the rest of our sports-team culture should be just as exciting. Let’s be real:  Harvard has a lot of things, but it sometimes feels like school spirit isn’t one of them. We want to advocate for increased funding and support for tailgate events so every home game feels more like Harvard-Yale. We will start with football and expand from there. Let’s make tailgates and sporting events a new focal point of inclusive social life. Let’s make college fun for everyone for more than just one weekend a year.
</p>
							<h1>>> LONG TERM <<</h1>
							<p><strong>Advise Administration to Purchase New Social Spaces. </strong>For inclusive parties, we have few options:  There are Northwest Labs, the Ten-Man, the Bell-tower, and the like, but we live on a campus of over 6000 students where most of us want to socialize on a frequent basis. So we will administration to find new social spaces to use to meet the demand, possibly around Harvard Square or on Garden Street. The fact is, they have the money to do it, and the current amount of social spaces isn’t enough.
