											<p>A first generation student of modest means, I made it thanks to support from my town and school community. This privilege, a strong support system, inspired me to put myself in a position to pay it forward to students who have a difficult time adjusting to Harvard and navigating the system and its challenges. 
</p>
												<p>I joined to UC to make a difference. So far, I’ve been successful. I’ve been a consistent champion for student group funding: I repealed a rule that stood between student organizations and dollars for an awareness campaign; I facilitated the process to request and receive grants for HUPD and venue fees; I’ve even met with dozens of student groups personally to workshop the UC grant process, resulting in thousands of dollars for clubs on campus, parties, and other student initiatives.</p>
											<p>William Morris and I know how effect change in the UC and on campus and will harness our experience and passion to shift the campus mental health, sexual abuse, and social space culture.

										<p> Like many of you, the day I got my acceptance letter was one of the happiest days of my life. Harvard was my dream for as long as I can remember. Sadly, for me at least, I was so underwhelmed by Harvard freshman year I wanted to transfer after only my first month here. Luckily, I decided to stay, and as a result have made lasting friendships with some of the brightest, most passionate individuals that I have ever known. Yet I still believe that this school has failed to live up to its potential, and I believe that for it to do so, we need a student government that advocates for the needs of student body, rather than being content with the status quo. </p>
											<p>Harvard is currently going through unprecedented change in a short amount of time. We need student leaders to help guide this change. When Greenlaw and I are done with our terms, we should be able to say confidently that we helped make Harvard a better place; that we helped Harvard reach the potential that we all know it has. 
</p> 
												<p>Of all the issues we plan to tackle, the one that I am committed to focusing on is mental health. I am an advocate because I have struggled with mental health personally and have seen untreated mental health conditions claim the lives of people that I love. Through my advocacy, I have written about my and my friends’ experiences with mental health struggles, collaborated with campus administrators, and worked with a number of organizations on and off campus to combat the stigma surrounding mental health to create a plan to improve our conditions. I believe is time for us to confront the issue of mental health head on, as a community, and I look forward to lending my voice to this effort.</p>
											<p>Please join us -- let us advocate for you. Let us advocate for a new culture here at Harvard, one where sometimes it’s okay not to be okay. We will not let you down.</p>
